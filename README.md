#### ssdump

#### encryptdat
Encrypts and decrypts the gameexe.dat.

#### siglusomv
Packs a yuv444p theora video into an omv file (recommended to be an encoded with -g 16, variable bitrate).

Note: yuv420p is the default color type in many video encoders, 
but the engine will crash if video is encoded as that. The theora video must be yuv444p.
